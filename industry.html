											I spent six years working in the Pacific Whale Watch Association as an on-board biologist/naturalist, supervisor, and 
										manager of local whale watching companies. As an on-board naturalist I educated guests on local whales and other marine 
										wildlife, conducting marine mammal lectures on large motor yachts.

											There are two different ecotypes of orcas in the Salish Sea, salmon eaters and marine mammal-eaters. Marine mammal-eating orcas,
											such as in this video, feed on seals, porpoise, and sea lions. They work together as a team within their family pod to take down
											prey.

										<h3><a href="#">My Favourite Family, the T2's</a></h3>
									</header>
									<p>

										One orca family has a long, well-known history in the Salish Sea, the T2's. Their story is one of survival, determination, and family.  Known as the first marine mammal-eating orcas to be captured in B.C., their family of five was contained in Pedder Bay in Victoria on March 1, 1970. At this time, humans were unaware that not all orcas eat salmon and so what follows is a harrowing story of survival at all costs, with these orcas being the only example we have of prey-switching behaviour. To read their whole story, click the link below.  The lineage of this amazing family can still be seen in our waters today (the T2C's) and has been my favourite family to watch over the years. Passing on their sense of determination and family values, this mother cared for her son Tumbo (T002C2), who was born with scoliosis of the spine, for 14 years before he passed. Ensuring he was fed for given that he was not able to fend for himself. Tumbo is pictured below, his irregular spine can be seen, taken in 2018. His older brother, Rocky (T002C1) can be seen in the photos below spyhopping, he was the first orca that I ever saw breach!
